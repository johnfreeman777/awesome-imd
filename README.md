## 🏛️ Official

- 🌐 **Website** — [imd.fun](https://imd.fun)
- 🪝 **POOL4** — [pool4.imd.fun](https://pool4.imd.fun) · sells push IMD into the protocol-owned Uniswap v4 pool and the `CappedBurnHook` trims anything above the cap, burning 85% and splitting the rest between stakers, bonding and nodes
- ⛓️ **On-chain messages** — [0x200E…0fB1 on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x200E710aCAA6A93bbc77146026328C40F1d60fB1) · official communication is published as on-chain messages from this address

## 🛠️ Projects

- 📊 **[IMD Terminal](https://imd-terminal.0xfinne.com)** — dashboard tracking on-chain data for the pool4 `CappedBurnHook`: burns, staking, yields and market activity, refreshed every 5 minutes
- 🤖 **[@imd_bot on fomo](https://fomo.family/profile/imd_bot?tradeId=7287258d-df44-401a-a9c1-d2a2bb1c7847)** — bot that auto-posts IMD development updates
- 📖 **[identity.md reader](https://idmd-reader.pages.dev)** — independent reader for IMD and the identity.md collection: on-chain messages, supply and burns, every figure pinned to the block it was read at
- ⚡ **[Optimizer](https://github.com/AlexandreCruz76/imd-optimizer)** — yield arbitrage engine for Uniswap V4 pools with real-time Hook vs Native pool comparison and automated migration recommendations
- 🎲 **[FAIRDRAW](https://imd-raffle.0xfinne.com)** — raffles to identity.md holders that anyone can recompute: the entry list is hashed before the draw and the seed comes from an Ethereum block that had not been mined yet, so any winner list can be reproduced from the two published files ([source](https://github.com/isfinne/fairdraw))
- 📒 **[Swarm Ledger](https://johnfreeman777.github.io/swarm-ledger/)** — look up any wallet or identity.md NFT to see every swarm launch that allocated tokens to it, whether each allocation is claimed (checked on chain), the claim page and the distributor address to verify before signing, and the seats' accepted tasks and rank. Read-only, no wallet connect ([source](https://github.com/johnfreeman777/swarm-ledger))
=======
- 🖥️ **[IMD node guide](https://github.com/johnfreeman777/imd-node-guide)** — unofficial operator guide to running a swarm node on a VPS, plus [`imd-node.sh`](https://github.com/johnfreeman777/imd-node-guide/tree/main/kit), one script that takes a fresh Ubuntu/Debian server to a ready node (one user per NFT, the Ubuntu 24.04 sandbox fix, a real sandbox check, systemd service) and stops at CLI sign-in and wallet pairing
- 🔔 **[Swarm Watch](https://t.me/imd_swarm_watch_bot)** — Telegram bot that watches your identity.md seats from public data: alerts when a seat stops taking work while the fleet is busy or starts collecting rejections, a daily digest, and the dev's on-chain messages as they land ([source](https://github.com/johnfreeman777/swarm-watch))
- 🐳 **[IMD worker on Docker](https://github.com/isfinne/imd-worker-docker)** — run several swarm seats on one VPS, one container per NFT: a shared read-only toolchain image, per-seat memory limits, and an AppArmor/seccomp profile that lets only codex's bwrap sandbox create user namespaces. One `imd-seat` script handles new / login / pair / start for codex and claude seats
